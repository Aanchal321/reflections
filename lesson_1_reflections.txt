How did viewing a diff between two 
versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?

By pointing out the differences,
diff helped find the bug at the
possible locations which are the
lines where changes were made.


How could having easy access to the
entire history of a file make you a
more efficient programmer in the long term?

By saving previous versions, in case of
any bug or typo in the new code, it can be
fixed by comparing the code with an older
one.


What do you think are the pros and cons of
manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Only logical changes are commited.
Cons: Commit size may be too small or too
big depending upon user indiscretion.


Why do you think some version control systems,
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

If changes are made across two or more 
inter-related files, it'll be easier if
at each commit all the related files are
saved together.
